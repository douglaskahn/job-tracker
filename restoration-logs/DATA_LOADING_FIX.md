# Job Tracker Troubleshooting Summary

## Issue
The frontend application was unable to load data from the backend. The error was:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
Error loading real data in loadData(): AxiosError
```

## Investigation Findings

1. **Port Configuration Mismatch**:
   - The frontend was trying to access the backend on port 8005 
   - The backend was configured to run on port 8006
   - Some components had hardcoded references to port 8005
   - Multiple files needed to be updated for consistency

2. **FastAPI Route Issues**:
   - The routes were correctly defined in the OpenAPI schema
   - However, the actual API routes were not responding (404 errors)
   - Possible causes: mount conflicts, middleware issues, code structure problems

3. **Database Initialization**:
   - The main database had data (60 records in applications table)
   - The demo database was empty
   - We've run `init_database.py` to populate the databases

## Solution

1. **Port Harmonization**:
   - Standardized on port 8006 for the backend
   - Updated `.env` to use BACKEND_PORT=8006
   - Updated `start-backend.sh` to use port 8006 
   - Updated hardcoded references in test components

2. **API Server Fix**:
   - Created a simple test FastAPI server (`test_server.py`)
   - This server provides basic endpoints that match the expected API
   - Updated `start-backend.sh` to use this server temporarily
   - The test server successfully returns data for `/applications/` and `/demo/applications/`

3. **Frontend Configuration**:
   - Ensured frontend is using the correct API base URL
   - Added debug code to verify API calls

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Original FastAPI Issues**:
   - Debug why the original FastAPI app's routes weren't responding
   - Check for conflicts between the `/app` and `/backend` directories
   - Look for middleware or mount conflicts in the original code

2. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add better error handling in the frontend for API failures
   - Provide clear user feedback when the backend is unavailable

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document the correct port configuration for future reference
   - Add more logging to help diagnose similar issues

4. **Testing**:
   - Add more comprehensive endpoint tests
   - Create a health check endpoint to verify API status

## Long-term Improvements

1. **Code Structure**:
   - Resolve the duplicate backend code in `/app` and `/backend`
   - Standardize on a single implementation

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Improve environment variable handling
   - Add validation for critical configuration
   - Add a setup script for new developers

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Add basic monitoring for backend health
   - Implement automatic reconnection logic
