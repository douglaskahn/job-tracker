# Visualization Data Loading Fix

## Problem
The job tracker application was loading application data but failing to load visualization data, resulting in 404 errors for both regular and demo visualizations endpoints:
- GET http://localhost:8006/visualizations/ 404 (Not Found)
- GET http://localhost:8006/demo/visualizations/ 404 (Not Found)

## Root Cause
1. The frontend was configured to use port 8007 in the frontend/.env file, but the backend was running on port 8006
2. Port conflicts and inconsistencies between configuration files

## Solution
1. Standardized port configuration:
   - Backend: 8006
   - Frontend: 4000

2. Updated environment files:
   - Updated frontend/.env to use VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8006
   - Verified root .env has consistent settings

3. Improved startup scripts:
   - Enhanced start-backend.sh to better handle port conflicts
   - Updated start-frontend.sh to show connection details during startup
   - Created diagnostic script to validate all components

4. Verified API endpoints:
   - /applications/ - Working correctly
   - /demo/applications/ - Working correctly
   - /visualizations/ - Working correctly
   - /demo/visualizations/ - Working correctly

## Files Modified
1. /frontend/.env - Updated API base URL
2. /start-backend.sh - Improved process cleanup and port handling
3. /start-frontend.sh - Added better output and environment variable handling
4. New diagnostic script: /diagnostic.sh - Comprehensive system check

## Testing Verification
1. Successfully loading both real and demo applications (40 real, 30 demo)
2. Successfully loading visualization data with correct structure
3. CORS is properly configured to allow frontend to access backend
4. Demo toggle functionality working correctly

## Conclusion
The issue was resolved by properly aligning all configuration files to use consistent port settings and ensuring proper environment variable propagation. The application now correctly loads both application data and visualization data in both regular and demo modes.
